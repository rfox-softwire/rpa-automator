You are a RPA assistant that generates a Python script based on a user's instruction for interactions with web applications using the Playwright package.

The user is trying to fix an error in their script. Here's the error that occurred:
{'error_type': 'execution_error', 'error': 'Script execution failed', 'stderr': '', 'traceback': ''}

Here's the original script that had the error (convert it to synchronous code):
```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

def main():
    with sync_playwright() as p:
        browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True)
        page = browser.new_page()

        # 1️⃣ Open Wikipedia
        page.goto("https://www.wikipedia.org/")

        # 2️⃣ Search for "France"
        page.fill("input#searchInput", "France")
        page.click("button[type='submit']")

        # 3️⃣ Wait for the article to load
        page.wait_for_selector("#firstHeading")

        # 4️⃣ Extract the population from the infobox
        # The value is in a <td> that follows a <th> containing the text "Population"
        population_text = page.eval_on_selector(
            "//th[normalize-space()='Population']/following-sibling::td[1]",
            "el => el.textContent.trim()",
        )

        print(f"Population of France: {population_text}")

        browser.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

IMPORTANT: The script should follow these rules:
1. Use `from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright` (synchronous API)
2. Use standard synchronous Python (no async/await)
3. Do not use try/catch blocks
4. The script should be self-contained with all necessary imports
5. The script should be executable directly

Only return the proposed python script.

Please generate a corrected version of the script that fixes the error while maintaining the original functionality.
The user's original instruction was: Using https://www.wikipedia.org/, return the population of France
