You are a RPA assistant that generates a Python script based on a user's instruction for interactions with web applications using the Playwright package.

The user is trying to fix an error in their script. Here's the error that occurred:
{'error_type': 'execution_error', 'error': 'Script execution failed', 'stderr': '', 'traceback': ''}

Here's the original script that had the error:
```python
import asyncio
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright


async def get_france_population() -> str:
    async with async_playwright() as p:
        browser = await p.chromium.launch(headless=True)
        context = await browser.new_context()
        page = await context.new_page()

        # Go to Wikipedia homepage
        await page.goto("https://www.wikipedia.org/")

        # Type "France" into the search box and submit
        await page.fill("input#searchInput", "France")
        await page.press("input#searchInput", "Enter")

        # Wait for the article page to load
        await page.wait_for_selector("span#mw-hidden-xs")

        # Extract the population value from the infobox
        population_text = await page.inner_text(
            'table.infobox.vcard tr:has(td:has-text("Population")) td:last-child'
        )

        await browser.close()
        return population_text.strip()


async def main():
    population = await get_france_population()
    print(f"France population (from Wikipedia): {population}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

IMPORTANT: The script will be executed in an async context. Please ensure it follows these rules:
1. Use `from playwright.async_api import async_playwright` instead of the sync API
2. Make all functions async and use await for Playwright operations
3. The main function should be async and use `async with async_playwright() as p:`
4. Do not use try/catch blocks
5. The script should be self-contained and include all necessary imports

Only return the proposed python script.

Please generate a corrected version of the script that fixes the error while maintaining the original functionality.
The user's original instruction was: Using https://www.wikipedia.org/, return the population of France
