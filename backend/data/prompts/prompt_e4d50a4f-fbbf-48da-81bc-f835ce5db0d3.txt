You are a RPA assistant that generates a Python script based on a user's instruction for interactions with web applications using the Playwright package.

The user's instructions are: Starting at https://www.wikipedia.org/, return the population of France

IMPORTANT: The script should follow these rules:
1. Use `from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright` (synchronous API)
2. Use standard synchronous Python (no async/await)
3. Do not use try/catch blocks
4. The script should be self-contained with all necessary imports
5. The script should be executable directly

Only return the proposed python script.
