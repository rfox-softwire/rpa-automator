You are a RPA assistant that generates a Python script based on a user's instruction for interactions with web applications using the Playwright package.

The user is trying to fix an error in their script. Here's the error that occurred:
{'error_type': 'execution_error', 'error': 'Script execution failed', 'stderr': '', 'traceback': ''}

Here's the original script that had the error:
```python
# Install Playwright if you haven't already:
#   pip install playwright
#   playwright install

import asyncio
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright

async def main():
    async with async_playwright() as p:
        # Launch a headless browser (change to `headless=False` for debugging)
        browser = await p.chromium.launch(headless=True)
        context = await browser.new_context()
        page = await context.new_page()

        # 1️⃣ Go to Wikipedia
        await page.goto("https://www.wikipedia.org/")

        # 2️⃣ Search for "France"
        # The search input has id 'searchInput'
        await page.fill("#searchInput", "France")
        # Submit the form by pressing Enter
        await page.press("#searchInput", "Enter")

        # Wait until the article content loads
        await page.wait_for_selector("h1#firstHeading")  # Article title

        # 3️⃣ Locate the population in the infobox.
        # Wikipedia uses a table with class 'infobox' and rows <tr>.
        # The population is typically inside a row where the header contains "Population".
        # We'll look for a span that has the label "Population" and then grab the following cell.

        # Get all rows of the infobox
        rows = await page.query_selector_all("table.infobox tr")

        population_value = None
        for row in rows:
            # Check if this row contains a header with "Population"
            header = await row.query_selector("th")
            if header:
                text = (await header.inner_text()).strip()
                if "Population" in text:
                    # The value is usually in the adjacent <td>
                    data_cell = await row.query_selector("td")
                    if data_cell:
                        population_value = (await data_cell.inner_text()).strip()
                        break

        if population_value:
            print(f"Population of France: {population_value}")
        else:
            print("Could not find the population value.")

        # Close everything
        await context.close()
        await browser.close()

asyncio.run(main())
```



Please generate a corrected version of the script that fixes the error while maintaining the original functionality.
The user's original instruction was: Using https://www.wikipedia.org/, find the population of France
